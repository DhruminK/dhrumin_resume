I took this decision as I really like the culture and job responsibility during my internship at Seashore Networks and decided to put hold on Ecole 42 degree of quite sometime till I finished that course in 2023.
Wrote clean, efficient, modular and optimized C code to emulate functions of PHY, MAC, RLC layers of LTE protocol stack as per 3GPP specifications. Some of the features for which I was directly involved in realizing include: -
Preforming encoding on Outgoing Data and Decoding on Incoming data as per 3GPP specified coding algorithms
Creating control data or metadata for outgoing data which helps the mobile phones in receiving data and identifying the data blocks relevant to the mobile phones
Converting the outgoing data bits to IQ Samples (complex value represent digit signals) using modulation schemes provided in the specification
Applying Discrete Fourier Transform on the Frequency Domain IQ Samples to get Time Domain IQ Samples which are then sent to Radio Unit(RU) to be converted to Analog Signals and transmitted via antennas
Notable accomplishment in the job was developing PRACH receiver using C which was solely developed by myself, this gave me quite a lot of understanding of Fourier Transforms and working knowledge of Digital Signal Processing.

Also worked on other projects during my job include :-
Using ReactJS to make working webpages for clients
Making basic docker containers which will host the final RAN when it is ready
Connecting Docker container to a FPGA using Network Function Virtualization, granting me understanding of pnf and vnfs`,
